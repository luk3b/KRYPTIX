                EDM is music that is made with tools like "samplers, synthesizers, effects units and MIDI controllers".<br>
                These help EDM artists create cool beats and rhythms that eventually get turned into music, <br>
                but in the 80's it was mostly "manipulating MIDI data". Its much easier though to create music <br>
                with better technology that allows EDM artists to create music at a much faster rate. <br> 
                </p>

                 EDM is made alot with MIDI controllers, and you may be confused what these are.<br>
                 Well an MIDI controller is "any hardware or software that generates and transmits<br>
                 Musical Instrument Digital Interface". MIDI controllers have probably been seen in<br>
                in your life, or have been heard of like "Keyboards are by far the most common type of<br>
                MIDI controller". So, MIDI controllers are not uncommonly heard and come in different varietis.<br>
